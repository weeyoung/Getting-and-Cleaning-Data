#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##Objective
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.


### Description and information of the data
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors

Data information is retrieved from the below website

Here are the data for the project:

### Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### Attribute Information:
For each record it is provided:
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Processing

The run_analysis.R script creates a tidy data set as follows:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Variables

All the column names are described in README.txt data source zip file, except for the following columns that were added:

* SubjectID: identifier for each subject
* Activity: a string that represent the activity of the subject while collecting data points

The tidy data contains :
* SubjectID - It is an identifier for each subject. Value is from 1 to 30.
* Activity - It represents the name of the activities. Values are "walking", "walking upstairs", "walking downstairs", "sitting", "standing" and "laying"
* Measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope
